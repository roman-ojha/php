*) Setup:
    -> install :
        -> PHP
        -> MySQL
        -> Apache Server
    -> we can install these thing differently but we will rather install Xampp server which will help us to install 'php', 'MySQL', 'Apache Server'
    -> most popular option are:
        -> Wamp(Windows + Apache + MySQL + PHP) server
        -> Xampp(Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl) server
    -> https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

*) Run:
    -> Run Xampp control
    -> start Apache
    -> start MySQL 
    -> now you have to write you project and your php file into given path folder:
        -> C:\xampp\htdocs
    -> 'htdocs' folder will contain all the files related to php program or project
    -> so, we will start this tutorial by putting this whole folder inside 'htdocs' folder
    -> now here we can create php file

*) Access Xampp:
    -> http://localhost/dashboard/
    => Open PHP file:
        -> http://localhost/<project_folder_name_inside_'htdocs'>
